# Quiz App example  [![deployed with: genezio](https://img.shields.io/badge/deployed_with-genezio-6742c1.svg?labelColor=62C353&style=flat)](https://github.com/genez-io/genezio)

This is an example of a quiz application with quest users that maintains a leaderboard. This uses React for the frontend application and Genezio for deploying and developing the backend.

Note: `genezio deploy` deploys both backend and frontend. If you want to test this example out-of-the-box by running 1 command, head to the `server` directory and run `genezio deploy`.

If you want to deploy your application step-by-step, follow the guidelines below.

## Clone the example
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/cristim67/example-genezio-ts-prisma`

## Initialization

1. Run `npm install` in the `server/` folder to install the dependencies.
2. Run `npm install` in the `client/` folder to install the dependencies.

## Run the example locally

1. Run `genezio local` in the `server/` folder to start the local server.
2. Start the React app by going to the `client/` folder and run `npm start`.

## Deploy the example in the Genezio infrastructure

1. Run `genezio deploy --backend` in the `server/` folder that contains also the `genezio.yaml` file. This will deploy your code in the Genezio infrastructure and it will also create an SDK that can be used to call the methods remotely.
2. Start the React app by going to the `client/` folder and run `npm start`.

## Deploy the frontend in Genezio Infrastructure
1. Run `npm i && npm run build` in the `client` folder to build the React app.
2. Run `genezio deploy --frontend` in the `server` folder to deploy the frontend in the Genezio infrastructure.
